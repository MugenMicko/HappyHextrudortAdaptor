# HappyHextrudortAdaptor
Here is the HappyHextrudort Adaptor to marry up the AfterSherpaMini Cowl with a VZ-HextrudORT!
With this great little compact and light CNC billet alloy extruder coming to market, we thought it might go nicely on top of out V0.1 Toolhead AfterSherpa Mini.
This work with the Vex3D's VZ-HextrudORT extruder and Annex Engineering's AfterSherpa Mini Cowling, allowing a huge range of hot ends to be used!!
Anyhow, enjoy this cheerful chap!
